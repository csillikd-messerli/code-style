# Messerli C# coding guidelines

These are the revised Coding Guidelines valid for code newly written in C\#.
If you see mistakes or have, comments do not hesitate in contacting the developer council.

## When and where are these rules applicable

These rules are applicable to all C\# code written at Messerli Informatik AG. 
The rules will not be enforced for old code, which has not been changed.
In a review, these coding guidelines should be checked for all code, which has changed.
Changes necessary due to the coding guidelines should be in a reasonable ratio to the functional changes.

## Update to the rules and glossary

Updates to the rules and glossary should be sent to the developer council. The developer council will integrate new rules or new words in the glossary in a timely fashion when the board approves and will give feedback otherwise.

## Definition of done
