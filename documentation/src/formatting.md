# Formatting rules

We use Visual Studio, ReSharper and CodeMaid to enforce most of the formatting rules. 

## Tool configurations
The Formatting Rules for Visual Studio, ReSharper and CodeMaid are checked into the Repository, and can be found in the CTO git-Repository in the folder Tool Configurations:

* .editorconfig
* CodeMaid.config
* MesserliResharper.DotSettings
* VS\_Format\_Settings.vssettings

## Indentation

For each scope that is opened, we indent by one level.
For indentation, we use only spaces, tabs are forbidden.
One level of indentation is four spaces.

## Maximum line length

There is no absolute maximum to the length of the line, but try to keep it on the screen.

## Empty lines

We use only one empty line to separate content.
